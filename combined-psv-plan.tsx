          <p className="text-gray-700">
            PSV Eindhoven, a global leader in the sports industry, is launching a new campaign to expand its market
            reach by targeting an underserved audience: elderly people aged 65 and older. This demographic presents
            unique challenges and opportunities, requiring a new approach to effectively engage them. The campaign aims
            to not only promote a new PSV Eindhoven initiative but also to consider the preferences and lifestyles of
            the elderly population.

          <p className="text-gray-700">
            As the global population ages, sports clubs must adapt to the evolving needs of older fans. The elderly
            market has specific preferences, including accessibility, engagement, and communication methods. However,
            traditional marketing strategies often overlook this demographic, leading to missed opportunities for
            engagement. This campaign seeks to bridge that gap by creating an inclusive and appealing branding strategy
            that resonates with older supporters.
