        <p className="text-gray-700">
          PSV Eindhoven, a global leader in the sports industry, is launching a new campaign to expand its market reach
          by targeting an underserved audience: elderly people aged 65 and older. This demographic presents unique
          challenges and opportunities, requiring a new approach to effectively engage them. The campaign aims to not
          only promote a new PSV Eindhoven initiative but also to consider the preferences and lifestyles of the elderly
          population.

        <p className="text-gray-700">
          As the global population ages, sports clubs must adapt to the evolving needs of older fans. The elderly market
          has specific preferences, including accessibility, engagement, and communication methods. However, traditional
          marketing strategies often overlook this demographic, leading to missed opportunities for engagement. This
          campaign seeks to bridge that gap by creating an inclusive and appealing branding strategy that resonates with
          older supporters.
